## üëã Introduction
This repository combines the dotfiles of Paul Irish with the powerbook of Ra√∫l Uranga. Its primary use is personal but feel free to suggest improvements or fork it!

## üõ†Ô∏è Application Installation

The base setup is performed in the `install.sh` script, which installs a variety of packages including brew (node, php, mongo, mysql, python, ruby), cask, some gems, npm global packages, and others.

## üîê Private Configuration

Store your private configurations in a file named `.extra` and avoid committing it to this repository. This file should be placed in your home directory (`~/`). Here's an example of how to set the PATH:

```shell

## PATH configuration
PATH=/opt/local/bin
PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/sbin
PATH=$PATH:/bin
PATH=$PATH:~/.rvm/bin
...

export PATH
```

## üîß OS X Default Settings

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults. Run the following script to do this:

```bash
./.osx
```

Note that Homebrew's package installation path differs based on the Mac model:

```bash
# Intel Chip
/usr/local/Homebrew/bin/brew

# Apple Silicon (M1, M2)
/opt/homebrew/bin/brew
```

## üíª Installation

To install, clone this repository to your `home directory`, navigate to it, and run `setup.sh`:

```bash
pinentry-program $(brew --prefix)/bin/pinentry-mac
```
